# Home-Automation
Controlling appliances using text messages with help of arduino and GSM module

# Objective:
1. to minimize the daily workload through automation.
2. GSM model implementation aims to promote high level of simplicity in operating our home appliances.
3. GSM controlled system will deploy the use of text messages through the user's smartphones.
4. Get rid of handling small day to day jobs manually.
5. Act as a helping hand for the disabled people, old aged people who are not able to do their tasks by themselves.
6. To Implement this technology so that the users can able to control their home appliances from far away from their home effectively.

# Requirements: 
1.	Arduino and the cables
2.	GSM Module and power supply adapter
3.	4-way Relay
4.	Software : Arduino IDE

# Steps:
1. Install Arduino IDE 
2. Make the circuits and given in the Images in Circuit Folder
3. Connect the arduino to system to upload the code
4. Set the port in Arduino IDE to which the arduino is connected
5. Check iif the GSM module is getting the signals
6. Upload the code to arduino
7. Connect the appliances to relay (exctly like so that relay acts as switch)

# Code Explanation
-Read the comments carefully in the code to understand it.
-All the msgs can be customed as per the needs
